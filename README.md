# Nexus Learn 

### Your Personalized AI-Powered Learning Journey

Nexus Learn is an AI-powered personal tutor, driven by Google Gemini, that delivers a fully customized learning experience tailored to each user's goals and existing knowledge. We are replacing static video lectures with an interactive, conversational learning environment that dynamically generates learning paths just for you.

---

## Product Description

Traditional online education platforms offer the same static content to every user. This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to individual learning paces and prior knowledge, leading to a loss of motivation and inefficiency.

Nexus Learn solves this problem by leveraging the power of Google Gemini. Our platform aims to transform learning from a passive consumption of content into a personal, adaptive, and interactive journey for every individual.

## Product Features

-    Dynamic Learning Maps: When a user enters a goal (e.g., "Become a React Developer"), our AI generates a visual and interactive "knowledge map" detailing all the necessary topics and their prerequisites.
-    Interactive Chat-Based Lessons: Each topic is taught through a conversation with Gemini. Users can ask questions instantly, request analogies, and progress at their own pace.
-    AI-Powered Practice & Feedback: At the end of each lesson, Gemini generates unique practice problems and provides instant, in-depth feedback on the user's solution (e.g., analyzing their code for efficiency and style).
-    On-Demand Course Generation (The Wow Factor): Our standout feature allows users to enter any topic not already in our system (e.g., "Introduction to Quantum Physics") and receive a brand-new, structured learning map in seconds.
-    Gamification & Progress Tracking: Points, badges, and learning streaks keep user motivation high and track their progress through their learning journey.

## Target Audience

-   Professionals looking to switch careers or learn a new technology.
-   Computer Science and Engineering students.
-   High school and university students seeking supplementary help for their courses (Math, Physics, Biology, etc.).
-   Anyone curious to learn about a new subject in a fast, structured, and engaging way.
